  Chorus.

       <P class = "speech"> <h6 class="YUM">YUM.</h6>  Yes, I am indeed beautiful!  Sometimes I sit and
  wonder, in my artless Japanese way, why it is that I am so much
  more attractive than anybody else in the whole world.  Can this
  be vanity?  No!  Nature is lovely and rejoices in her loveliness.
  I am a child of Nature, and take after my mother.</p>

                            <p class ="song"><h6>YUM:</h6>.

                 The sun, whose rays
                 Are all ablaze
                      With ever-living glory,
                 Does not deny
                 His majesty—
                      He scorns to tell a story!</p>
                
                   Enter Pitti-Sing and Peep-Bo.

       <p class = "speech"><h6 class = "YUM">YUM.</h6>  Yes, everything seems to smile upon me.  I am to be
  married to-day to the man I love best and I believe I am the very
  happiest girl in Japan!</p>
       <p class ="speech"><h6 class ="PEE">PEE</h6>  The happiest girl indeed, for she is indeed to be
  envied who has attained happiness in all but perfection.
  Enter Nanki-Poo, followed by Go-To.</p>

      <p class ="speech"> <h6 class="NAN"> NAN</h6>  Yum-Yum in tears—and on her wedding morn!</p>
       <p class ="speech"><h6 class="YUM">YUM.</h6>  (sobbing).  They've been reminding me that in a month
  you're to be beheaded!  (Bursts into tears.)</p>
      <p class="speech"><h6 class="PIT">PIT</h6>  Yes, we've been reminding her that you're to be
  beheaded.  (Bursts into tears.) </p> 
      <p class ="speech"><h6 class="PEE"> PEE</h6>  It's quite true, you know, you are to be beheaded!
  (Bursts into tears.)</p> 
       <p class="speech"><h6 class="NAN">NAN</h6>  (aside).  Humph!  Now, some bridegrooms would be
  depressed by this sort of thing!  (Aloud.)  A month?  Well,
  what's a month?  Bah!  These divisions of time are purely
  arbitrary.  Who says twenty-four hours make a day?</p>
