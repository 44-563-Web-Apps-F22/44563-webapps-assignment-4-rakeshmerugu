            "SCENE.—Ko-Ko's Garden.

  <p>Yum-Yum discovered seated at her bridal toilet, surrounded by
     maidens, who are dressing her hair and painting her face and
     lips, as she judges of the effect in a mirror.</p>

      <p> ITTI-SING.

                 Sit with downcast eye
                      Let it brim with dew—
                 Try if you can cry—
                      We will do so, too.
                 When you're summoned, start
                      Like a frightened roe—
                 Flutter, little heart,  Braid the raven hair—
                      Weave the supple tress—
                 Deck the maiden fair
                      In her loveliness—
                 Paint the pretty face—
                      Dye the coral lip—
                 Emphasize the grace
                      Of her ladyship!
                 Art and nature, thus allied,
                 Go to make a pretty bride.

                      Colour, come and go!
                 Modesty at marriage-tide
                 Well becomes a pretty bride!

  <h4>CHO</h4> rus <br>
  <p>

       YUM.  Yes, I am indeed beautiful!  Sometimes I sit and
  wonder, in my artless Japanese way, why it is that I am so much
  more attractive than anybody else in the whole world.  Can this
  be vanity?  No!  Nature is lovely and rejoices in her loveliness.
  I am a child of Nature, and take after my mother.

                            SONG—YUM-YUM.

                 The sun, whose rays
                 Are all ablaze
                      With ever-living glory,
                 Does not deny
                 His majesty—
                      He scorns to tell a story!
                 He don't exclaim,
                      "I blush for shame,
                      So kindly be indulgent."
                 But, fierce and bold,
                 In fiery gold,
                      He glories effulgent!

                      I mean to rule the earth,
                           As he the sky—
                      We really know our worth,
                           The sun and I!
                           <br>
                         </p>
        </br>
             <p>    Observe his flame,
                 That placid dame,
                      The moon's Celestial Highness;
                 There's not a trace
                 Upon her face
                      Of diffidence or shyness:
                 She borrows light
                 That, through the night,
                      Mankind may all acclaim her!
                 And, truth to tell,
                 She lights up well,
                      So I, for one, don't blame her!

                      Ah, pray make no mistake,
                           We are not shy;
                      We're very wide awake,
                           The moon and I!

                   Enter Pitti-Sing and Peep-Bo.</p>

       <h4>YUM</h4>. <br>
       <p> Yes, everything seems to smile upon me.  I am to be
  married to-day to the man I love best and I believe I am the very
  happiest girl in Japan!
       PEEP.  The happiest girl indeed, for she is indeed to be
  envied who has attained happiness in all but perfection.
</p>
       <h4>YUM</h4>. <p>In "all but" perfection?
